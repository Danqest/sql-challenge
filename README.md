# sql-challenge

This project is an excercise in utilizing PostgreSQL to create database schema tables, import csv data, and execute complex queries to analyze the dataset.
An Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables and relationships is provided within the Schema folder to visualize the data models with defined primary keys and foreign keys along with specificed data types and other constraints.
After importing the dataset into the tables, complex queries are crafted and run to show various facets of the data analysis which makes use of JOINs among other parameters.
